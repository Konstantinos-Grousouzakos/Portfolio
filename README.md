Throughout this portfolio, you'll discover a collection of projects spanning various aspects of data science, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive analytics, and the implementation of Machine Learning models. These projects not only showcase my technical abilities but also reflect my analytical mindset and problem-solving approach.

In the "Absenteeism Data Cleaning Project" file, I tackled an exercise centered around data cleaning and preparation, which was a component of "The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp 2023" provided by 365Careers.

Additionally, the "Applied Data Science Capstone (IBM Data Science Professional Certificate)" file contains my final project for the IBM Data Scientist Certification.

Furthermore, in the "Predicting Death Rate From Cancer" and "Predicting Heart Disease" files, you'll find projects that I undertook independently to further refine my skills in data science.

As I continue to grow in this field, my aim is to further expand this portfolio with diverse projects that highlight my skills and unique perspective. Any feedback you may have is greatly appreciated, as I strive to continuously improve and refine my craft.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.

Warm regards,
Konstantinos Grousouzakos
