Hello,

My name is Konstantinos Grousouzakos, and I'm driven to pursue a career in Data Analysis and Data Science. While my academic background lies in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Industrial Engineering, my true passion lies in statistics and leveraging data for informed decision-making.

Throughout this portfolio, you'll discover a collection of projects spanning various aspects of data science, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive analytics, and the implementation of Machine Learning models. These projects not only showcase my technical abilities but also reflect my analytical mindset and problem-solving approach.

As I continue to grow in this field, my aim is to further expand this portfolio with diverse projects that highlight my skills and unique perspective. Any feedback you may have is greatly appreciated, as I strive to continuously improve and refine my craft.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.

Warm regards,
Konstantinos Grousouzakos
